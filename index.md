# AMWA IS-07 NMOS Event and Tally Specification [Work In Progress]

AMWA has reserved IS-07 for an NMOS Specification for event and tally

It has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initative.

See [here](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifcations.

The formal IS-07 Specification will be provided in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-). These pages provide supporting documentation and HTML renders of the APIs (which for previous AMWA ;spspecificatis have been RAML and JSON Schema).

The links below are for the “master” branch of the repo. This will (once completed and approved) typically the same as the most recent release of the Specification. Links to other releases (tags) and other branches appear later in the page.

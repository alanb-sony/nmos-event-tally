# AMWA IS-07 NMOS Event and Tally Specification

AMWA has reserved IS-07 for an NMOS Specification for event and tally

It has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initative.

See [here](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifcations.

The formal IS-07 Specification is provided in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-event-tally). These pages provide supporting documentation and HTML renders of the APIs (RAML and JSON Schema).

The documenation and API links immediately below, and the links in the page heading, are for the _most recent approved release_ of the Specification (which may be earlier than what is shown by the default branch on the GitHub repo). Links to [other releases (tags)](tags/) and [other branches](branches/) appear later in the page, or under "VERSIONS..." in the page heading.

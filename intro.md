AMWA NMOS IS-07 provides a mechanism by which to emit and consume states and state changes issued by sources (sensors, actuators etc).

It has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initative.

See [here](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifications.

The formal IS-07 Specification is provided in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-event-tally). These pages provide supporting documentation and HTML renders of the APIs (RAML and JSON Schema).

The documentation and API links immediately below, and the links in the page heading, are for the _most recent approved release_ of the Specification (which may be earlier than what is shown by the default branch on the GitHub repo). Links to [other releases (tags)](tags/) and [other branches](branches/) appear later in the page, or under "VERSIONS..." in the page heading.

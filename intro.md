# AMWA IS-07 NMOS Event and Tally Specification

AMWA has reserved IS-07 for an NMOS Specification for event and tally

It has been developed by the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://www.amwa.tv) as part of the [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://www.nmos.tv) initative.

See [here](https://amwa-tv.github.io/nmos) for an overview of NMOS specifcations.

The formal IS-07 Specification will be provided in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos-event-tally). These pages provide supporting documentation and HTML renders of the APIs (which for previous AMWA ;spspecificatis have been RAML and JSON Schema).

Once published, the links immediately below will be for the _most recent approved release_ of the Specification (which may be earlier than what is shown by the default branch on the GitHub repo). Until then it shows the most approriate working branch of the repo. Links to other releases (tags) and other branches appear later in the page.

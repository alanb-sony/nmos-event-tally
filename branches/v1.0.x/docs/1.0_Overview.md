# Overview

The purpose of the Event & Tally specification is to provide a mechanism by which to emit and consume state changes issued by sources (sensors, actuators etc). This is by no means a control API and controlling or sending commands to a receiver is out of scope. States sent need to be for general consumption which is to say they should not be sent with a specific receiver in mind (all states need to be consumable by any compatible receiver).

The specification is split into the following sections:

* [Event types](2.0_Event_types.md)
* [Core models](3.0_Core_models.md)
* [MQTT transport](4.0_MQTT_transport.md)
* [Websocket transport](5.0_Websocket_transport.md)
* [AMQP transport](6.0_AMQP_transport.md)
* [REST API (Late joiners)](7.0_Rest_api_late_joiners.md)
